    "# Naive Bayes Models and Probabilistic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a doctor trying to diagnose if a patient has the flu. You look at their symptoms: fever, cough, and fatigue. Naive Bayes helps you calculate the probability that they have the flu based on these symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"Naive\" Part**: We assume that having a fever doesn't affect whether you have a cough (which isn't always true in real life, but it makes the math much simpler!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It's Useful**:\n",
    "- **Gives you probabilities**: Instead of just saying \"yes flu\" or \"no flu\", it tells you \"80% chance of flu\"\n",
    "- **Really fast**: Great for when you need quick answers\n",
    "- **Works with little data**: Doesn't need thousands of examples to work well\n",
    "- **Easy to understand**: You can actually explain why it made a decision\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Math (Simply!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry - we'll break this down step by step!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Idea: Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "Think of it like this: **\"What's the chance of X happening, given that Y already happened?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: What's the chance it's raining, given that people are carrying umbrellas?\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula looks scary, but it's just:\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(Rain | Umbrellas) = P(Umbrellas | Rain) Ã— P(Rain) / P(Umbrellas)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English:\n",
    "- **P(Umbrellas | Rain)**: How often do people carry umbrellas when it's raining? (Probably high!)\n",
    "- **P(Rain)**: How often does it rain in general? (Depends on your city)\n",
    "- **P(Umbrellas)**: How often do people carry umbrellas? (Rain or shine)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Naive\" Assumption Explained\n",
    "**What we assume**: Each piece of evidence is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When diagnosing flu, we assume:\n",
    "- Having a fever doesn't make you more likely to have a cough\n",
    "- Having a cough doesn't make you more likely to be tired\n",
    "- (This isn't always true in real life, but it makes the math work!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How We Make Predictions\n",
    "We calculate the probability for each possible answer and pick the highest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Is this email spam?\n",
    "- Calculate: P(Spam | email words)\n",
    "- Calculate: P(Not Spam | email words)  \n",
    "- Pick whichever is higher!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Types Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these as different tools for different jobs - like using different types of hammers for different nails!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "**When to use**: When your data is numbers that follow a \"bell curve\" pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: Predicting if someone will like a movie based on:\n",
    "- Their age (continuous number: 25, 34, 67...)\n",
    "- How many movies they watch per month (continuous: 2.5, 8.2, 15.1...)\n",
    "- Their rating of similar movies (continuous: 6.7, 8.2, 4.1...)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Gaussian\"**: It assumes data follows a normal distribution (that classic bell-shaped curve you see everywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Explanation**: \"Most people are average, few are extreme\" - like height, where most people are medium height, few are very tall or very short.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multinomial Naive Bayes  \n",
    "**When to use**: When you're counting things (like words in a document)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: Detecting spam emails by counting words:\n",
    "- Email 1: \"free\" appears 5 times, \"money\" appears 3 times, \"click\" appears 7 times\n",
    "- Email 2: \"meeting\" appears 2 times, \"project\" appears 4 times, \"deadline\" appears 1 time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Multinomial\"**: It's like rolling a dice with many sides - each word is a side, and we're counting how many times each side comes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Explanation**: \"Show me what words you use, and I'll tell you what type of document this is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "**When to use**: When features are just YES/NO, ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: Diagnosing a disease based on symptoms:\n",
    "- Fever: YES or NO\n",
    "- Cough: YES or NO  \n",
    "- Headache: YES or NO\n",
    "- Nausea: YES or NO\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Bernoulli\"**: Named after a coin flip - each feature is either heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Explanation**: \"Does the patient have this symptom or not?\" - it doesn't matter how severe, just present or absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Your Own (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple Naive Bayes classifier! We'll create one that predicts if someone will like a movie based on their age and how many movies they watch per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Let's say we have this training data:\n",
    "# Person | Age | Movies/Month | Likes Action Movies?\n",
    "# Alice  | 25  | 8           | Yes\n",
    "# Bob    | 45  | 2           | No  \n",
    "# Carol  | 22  | 12          | Yes\n",
    "# Dave   | 50  | 1           | No\n",
    "# Eve    | 28  | 6           | Yes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal**: Given a new person (age 30, watches 5 movies/month), predict if they'll like action movies.\n",
    "\n",
